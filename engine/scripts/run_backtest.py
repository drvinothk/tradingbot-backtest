"""Replays real historical market data through the actual production
strategy pipeline (`strategy_engine.runner.run_cycle`, the real `Strategy`
subclasses, and Risk Service's `evaluate_trade_intent`) and reports
simulated trade performance — not a reimplementation of any strategy's
entry logic, per the same "reuse the real pipeline" principle a prior
backtest harness on this branch used (that harness, plus its
`query_backtest_trades.py` exit-reconstruction companion, was deleted
2026-08-15 for an unrelated reason — see CLAUDE.md's Phase 5 section and
project memory `project_backtest_infra_and_atr_risk_engine.md`; this is a
fresh implementation, not a recovery of that code).

Usage:
    python scripts/run_backtest.py --strategy orb --underlying NIFTY \\
        --from 2026-08-13 --to 2026-08-17

Requires `backend/data/historical/` populated by
`scripts/fetch_truedata_historical.py` first (see that script's own
docstring) — this script fails loudly, not silently, if the expected CSVs
aren't there.

Every `StrategyRun` here uses `execution_mode=APPROVAL_REQUIRED` — but
**this does not actually gate anything in this backtest** (2026-08-23
correction, found live while validating today's changes): every
`TradingSession` this script seeds is `paper_only`, and
`risk_engine.service.evaluate_trade_intent`'s mode-aware rule (added
2026-08-19, postdating this script's original design and assumption
below) auto-dispatches every paper trade "regardless of the strategy's
configured execution_mode" (see that function's own comment). So a
risk-approved signal here reaches `TradeIntentStatus.DISPATCHED`, not
`PENDING_APPROVAL` as originally assumed — which DOES call
`execution_engine.paper.service.dispatch_trade_intent`, which DOES create
a real `Position`/`Order`/`StopPlan`/`TrailPlan` row (stamped with real
wall-clock time, since nothing in this script corrects those rows'
timestamps the way `_correct_timestamps` does for `TradeIntent`/`Signal`/
`RiskDecision`). This is harmless for this script's own results — nothing
below ever reads those four tables, `PositionManager` is never started,
and `_reconstruct_exit`'s own hand-rolled forward-walk uses only
`TradeIntent`'s (correctly, simulated-time-corrected) fields — but it left
stray real-shaped rows with wrong timestamps sitting in the backtest DB,
and, more importantly, an earlier version of this script's own
`is_approved` check (`status == PENDING_APPROVAL` only) silently treated
every one of these as "not approved", discarding every real trade and
always reporting zero — fixed by accepting both statuses as "risk
approved" below. This script's own `_reconstruct_exit` walks the saved
option-contract bars forward from each approved `TradeIntent`'s entry
point, applying the *same* stop/target/trail math
`execution_engine.paper.service.evaluate_open_position` uses (steps 1, 2,
5 of that function — see its own docstring), to compute a realized exit —
this part of the design is unaffected by the above, since it never
depended on which status name reflected "approved".

Known, deliberate approximations/limitations (also called out at the end of
the printed report — do not treat this backtest's numbers as more precise
than they are):

- **`legacy`/`near_only`/`far_only`/`no_target_only`/`split_30_30_40`/
  `target_mult` still don't model structure-break/spread-blowout exits and
  still use close-only pricing** (`_reconstruct_exit`/`_reconstruct_exit_
  legs`, deliberately untouched — see `legacy`'s own promise below). Use
  `--exit-mode current` for the faithful reconstruction; these other modes
  exist specifically as deliberate what-if *target*-mechanism substitutions
  (near/far pivot targets, no target, a split, a scaled target) layered on
  top of `legacy`'s own baseline mechanics, not faithful simulations in
  their own right — their PnL reads more optimistic than a real run's
  would, for exactly the reasons below.
- **`current` (2026-08-27, default) models all 5 real steps of
  `evaluate_open_position`** — stop, target, structure-break,
  spread-blowout, trail, in that exact production order — using each bar's
  high/low, not just its close (`_reconstruct_exit_current`). Two genuine,
  permanent limitations remain even here, since no historical source (this
  script's own or any other) offers finer than 1-min OHLCV bars: (1) every
  strategy's real `structure_break_persistence_seconds` default (6.0s) is
  always exceeded by a single 1-min bar, so the persistence timer collapses
  to "survives to the next completed bar" rather than production's real
  "survives ~2 live 3s poll cycles"; (2) same-bar ties (a bar's range
  satisfying more than one condition at once — impossible on a live tick,
  common at 1-min resolution) are resolved via production's own fixed
  check order (stop → target → structure-break → spread-blowout → trail),
  the conservative/loss-first reading, confirmed with the user rather than
  silently chosen.
- **VWAP is computed from bar close+volume, one sample per completed bar**,
  not true tick-level cumulative VWAP. `IndicatorEngine.on_completed_bar`
  (the method this script uses for EMA9/EMA20, since historical rows are
  already-completed bars, not raw ticks) deliberately skips VWAP entirely —
  see that method's own docstring ("a discrete completed candle can't
  correctly feed a tick/volume-cumulative concept one sample at a time").
  This script feeds `market_data.indicators.vwap.VWAPCalculator` directly,
  once per bar, as the best available approximation; VWAP Pullback is the
  only strategy this affects.
- **Real finding, not a backtest-script bug**: TrueData's underlying index
  bars (NIFTY/BANKNIFTY) always carry `volume=0` (confirmed in the fetched
  CSVs — real, not a fetch defect; an index has no traded volume of its
  own). `VWAPCalculator.value` is `None` for as long as cumulative volume
  stays `0`, which it always will off underlying-index bars alone. VWAP
  Pullback will very likely never fire against this data for exactly this
  reason — and since production's own live feeds report the same `volume=0`
  for index ticks (`PriceCandle`'s own docstring says as much), this is
  very likely a pre-existing gap in live VWAP Pullback too, not something
  introduced by this backtest. Flagged here, not fixed — out of scope for
  this task.
- **Bid/ask and depth are synthetic, derived from OI/volume as a liquidity
  proxy** (2026-08-23, explicit user decision — "arbitrary but consistent"
  rather than dropping the spread/depth scoring components entirely, since
  TrueData's historical REST endpoint returns OHLCV+OI only, never a real
  bid/ask or order-book depth). Within each cycle's chain snapshot,
  `HistoricalBrokerAdapter.get_option_chain` computes a 0..1
  `liquidity_score` per contract (0.5 * normalized OI + 0.5 * normalized
  volume, min-max across that cycle's contracts — the same `_normalize`
  shape `strike_ranking.engine` itself uses) and derives both from it:
  `spread_pct` interpolates between `MIN_SYNTHETIC_SPREAD_PCT` (tightest,
  most-liquid strike) and `MAX_SYNTHETIC_SPREAD_PCT` (widest, least-liquid)
  — replacing the old flat +/-0.25% half-spread — and `depth_qty` scales
  the same score up to `MAX_SYNTHETIC_DEPTH_QTY`, written as a real
  `DepthSnapshotRow` per contract (deleted and reinserted every cycle,
  mirroring the existing `OptionChainSnapshotRow` forced-refresh pattern
  below) so `rank_from_latest_snapshot`'s existing depth query picks it up
  unmodified — production ranking code itself is untouched, only this
  script's own data fabrication changed. A real spread/real order book
  would change which strike gets picked some of the time; this is a
  best-effort stand-in, not a claim of precision. `--exit-mode current`'s
  spread-blowout check (`_spread_pct_at`) reuses this exact same formula at
  exit-walk timestamps too (2026-08-27) — a **permanent** ceiling, not a
  temporary gap: no historical source available to this script (TrueData
  archive, Shoonya TPSeries, Alice Blue) carries real bid/ask/depth at any
  granularity. The only way to ever close this for real is a forward-only
  live-tick/quote capture pipeline (recording from today onward — doesn't
  help re-simulate any already-past day) — scoped as a distinct future
  effort, not part of this script.
- `Instrument.lot_size`/`tick_size` (`UNDERLYING_META` below) are real,
  user-confirmed values (2026-08-27: NIFTY 65, BANKNIFTY 30 — replacing the
  old illustrative `domain.market.mock_universe._UNDERLYINGS` test values,
  which were off by ~2.6x for NIFTY). BANKNIFTY has never been traded live
  by this system — backtest-only, no production `Instrument` row exists to
  cross-check against — so its figure rests on the user's own confirmation,
  not an independent re-derivation. `RiskLimitConfig`/`TradingSession`
  budget/loss-cap/profit-target values are set deliberately generous so the
  backtest exercises real risk checks (tick-size alignment, price-drift,
  same-strike locking, margin) without being gated by arbitrary limits.
- **No cross-trade P&L feedback.** Since no `Position` ever closes (see
  above), `TradingSession.cumulative_realized_pnl`/`consecutive_losses`
  never update and `record_trade_outcome_effects` never runs — every
  signal is risk-evaluated independently of this backtest's own prior
  simulated outcomes, same limitation the deleted prior harness had for the
  identical structural reason.
- **Indicator warm-up**: this script primes `IndicatorEngine`/VWAP off
  every available underlying bar *before* `--from` (persisted, but with
  `strategy.evaluate()` never called) so EMA9/EMA20 aren't cold on the
  first replayed day — but a strategy's own in-memory per-run state
  (`ORBStrategy._fired_directions`, `EMAMicroPullbackStrategy
  .trades_fired_count`, etc.) still starts fresh at `--from`, same as a
  real `StrategyRunner` restarting fresh that morning would.
- **The option-chain freshness gate is wall-clock-based, not
  simulation-clock-based** (`market_data.freshness.ensure_fresh_option_chain`
  compares a snapshot's age against real `datetime.now(UTC)`). A fast
  replay would otherwise refresh the very first snapshot, then keep reading
  it as "fresh" for the rest of the run since real wall-clock barely moves
  between cycles. This script works around that explicitly by deleting the
  `OptionChainSnapshot` row for this instrument+expiry before every cycle,
  forcing `ensure_fresh_option_chain` to always see "no snapshot" (DEAD) and
  fetch a new one from `HistoricalBrokerAdapter` at the current simulated
  time — not a threshold hack, an explicit, deterministic reset.

Known pitfalls when doing a TARGETED rerun of only specific days from a
prior baseline (2026-08-26, `--dates`/`--pairs` below) -- three real,
non-obvious problems hit building this, each costing real wall-clock time
to diagnose because they only surface partway through a long run, not at
startup:

- **A day can genuinely fall inside more than one expiry directory's data
  range.** Real weekly-option contracts get listed weeks before their own
  expiry, so `_expiry_data_range()`'s true min/max for one expiry directory
  routinely reaches back 1-3 *other* expiry cycles' worth of calendar days.
  A naive "find the nearest expiry directory by name" guess for a given day
  (no data-range check) can pick a directory that is empty or simply
  doesn't cover that day at all — confirmed live: the nearest-by-name
  directory to 2025-08-19 was 2025-08-26, which had zero files, while the
  real data for that day lived in the 2025-09-02 directory (it starts
  2025-08-19, two weeks before its own expiry). `--dates` fixes this by
  reusing `--all-expiries`'s own already-correct range-checked iteration as
  a filter, never guessing.
- **That same overlap means an isolated single-day replay can "find" trades
  the original full sweep never actually recorded.** The original
  `--all-expiries` sweep keeps ONE continuous database/StrategyRun per
  expiry directory across that directory's *entire* multi-day range, and
  since a dispatched trade's `Position` never actually closes during replay
  (exits are reconstructed offline, afterward — see "No cross-trade P&L
  feedback" above), an earlier day's still-technically-open position can
  risk-reject (same-strike lock, concurrency) a later, overlapping day's
  signal *within that same continuous run*. Replaying each target day in
  total isolation (a fresh, empty database per day) removes that blocking
  state entirely, so a day covered by 3-4 overlapping expiry directories
  can independently "succeed" in every one of them, producing 2-3x more
  candidate trades than the original baseline ever recorded for that day.
  Confirmed live: 2025-09-23 and 2025-09-30 each produced 3 candidate
  trades in isolation vs. the 1 the original baseline actually recorded for
  each. Don't treat an isolated targeted rerun's own trade *count* as
  ground truth for which trades were real -- it isn't.
- **Seeding the same real expiry's option contracts twice in one process
  collides on real, global uniqueness constraints**
  (`uq_instrument_symbol_exchange`, `uq_option_contract_symbol` — the
  latter is on the actual broker symbol string, e.g.
  "NIFTY25093024350CE", which is NOT scoped to this script's own
  per-expiry `Instrument` isolation trick). This *will* happen the moment
  more than one requested day/pair maps to the same expiry directory
  within a single process (the norm once the overlap above is accounted
  for) unless the database is reset between calls — `--dates`/`--pairs`
  both call `Base.metadata.drop_all`/`create_all` before every single-day
  `_run_single_backtest` call for exactly this reason. Cheap per call (one
  day's worth of data), but real DDL overhead multiplies fast if a naive
  `--dates` filter processes every overlapping directory per day instead
  of the one that's actually real.

**The fix that sidesteps all three at once, when the exact answer is
already known**: a real option-contract symbol encodes its own real expiry
date (e.g. "NIFTY25093024350CE" -> 2025-09-30) — parsing that directly out
of a prior baseline CSV's own rows gives the EXACT (day, expiry) pair each
real trade actually came from, with zero ambiguity and zero redundant
overlap. `--pairs 'YYYY-MM-DD:YYYY-MM-DD,...'` takes that directly (day and
expiry directory both named explicitly, no scan, no guessing, no
post-filtering needed) — strictly preferred over `--dates` whenever a
baseline CSV to parse pairs from already exists; `--dates` is the fallback
for when it doesn't (e.g. targeting days that never had a prior baseline
run at all) and must therefore accept the overlap cost above.

    run — see `_reconstruct_exit`'s own docstring; this is a deliberately
    SEPARATE function, not a refactor of it, for exactly the same
    reproducibility reason `_reconstruct_exit_legs` already gives for its
    own separateness).

    Implements all 5 real steps of `execution_engine.paper.service
    .evaluate_open_position` — stop, target, structure-break,
    spread-blowout, trail, in that exact order — using each bar's high/low,
    not just its close, since production checks live ticks continuously
    rather than once a minute. See module docstring's "Known, deliberate
    approximations" section for what's now modeled vs. what remains a
    genuine, permanent ceiling of the historical data available (no source
    offers real bid/ask or sub-minute bars).

    `qty_lots` is an explicit caller-supplied value (today, `1` — same as
    `legacy`/`target_mult`), not `trade_intent.qty_lots` (which is always
    the pinned stub `1` regardless of exit-mode — set once at
    signal-generation time before any exit-mode branching runs, see
    `strategy_config_stub`'s own comment). 2026-08-27, explicit user
    decision: paper trading's own real 10-lot sizing is a deliberate paper-
    only choice, not something backtest (or live) needs to mirror — "fine
    to run backtest and live with 1x lot, unless I ask to change." Kept as
    a caller-supplied parameter, not hardcoded inline, for exactly that
    "unless I ask to change" case — the same established pattern
    `_reconstruct_exit_legs`'s own `LegSpec.qty_lots` already uses.

    Same-bar tie-break (confirmed with the user, 2026-08-27 fidelity plan):
    a single bar's [low, high] range can plausibly satisfy more than one
    condition at 1-min granularity — a real, common occurrence here even
    though it's near-impossible on a live tick. Resolved by applying
    production's own fixed check order (the loop below) and taking the
    first condition, in that order, whose broadened intrabar test is true —
    conservative/loss-first, matching both production's own stated
    defense-in-depth reasoning (`evaluate_open_position`'s own docstring)
    and this file's established "never read more optimistic than a real
    run would" philosophy.

    Known, permanent limitations kept honest here rather than glossed over:
    the structure-break persistence timer (every strategy's real default is
    6.0s, `common_rules.DEFAULT_STRUCTURE_BREAK_PERSISTENCE_SECONDS`)
    always collapses to "survives to the next completed 1-min bar" at this
    granularity, not production's real "survives ~2 live 3s poll cycles" —
    unavoidable at 1-min resolution. Spread-blowout still relies on the
    same synthetic OI/volume-derived proxy used everywhere else in this
    script (no historical source — TrueData, Shoonya TPSeries, Alice
    Blue — offers real bid/ask/depth at any granularity). The trail's
    same-bar tightening can't distinguish a genuine intra-minute
    run-up-then-reversal from a last-second spike-then-reversal — both
    produce identical OHLC.

# evaluating N independently-managed "legs" of the same entry instead of
# one -- each leg shares the same entry/stop, but can have its own target
# rule: a classic-floor-pivot level on the *underlying* (near = R1/S1, far
# = R2/S2 -- see backtest_pivots.py) or no target at all (a pure
# trail-only runner). See project plan / memory for the full design
# writeup ("Pivot-level split-leg exits for backtesting").
#
# Deliberately a SEPARATE function from `_reconstruct_exit`, not a
# refactor of it -- `_reconstruct_exit` stays byte-for-byte unchanged so
# `--exit-mode legacy` (the default) keeps reproducing every baseline CSV
# already gathered this week, not just "should be equivalent."

    real strategy/risk pipeline above, which produces an identical set of
    approved `TradeIntent`s regardless of exit-mode -- exit-mode only
    affects the final reconstruction step. Passing more than one mode here
    reuses that single replay pass and reconstructs it N ways instead of
    requiring N full separate invocations (each redoing the same expensive
    replay for a difference that only shows up in the last few lines) --
    the reason `--exit-mode all` exists on `main()`'s own CLI flag.

    `fast` (2026-08-24, off by default -- every run before this date, and
    every run today that doesn't pass `--fast`, is completely unaffected):
    on each main-window bar, the original loop opens 4 separate DB
    transactions -- persist the underlying bar, delete the stale
    option-chain snapshot, `HistoricalBrokerAdapter`'s own extra commit for
    the synthetic depth rows, and `run_cycle` itself. `fast=True` merges
    these into 2: bar-persist + snapshot-delete share one transaction, and
    `historical_broker.set_current_db(db)` (cleared again right after) lets
    the depth write land inside `run_cycle`'s own transaction instead of
    opening a third. This changes nothing about *what* gets written or
    read or in what order -- Postgres read-committed isolation already
    guarantees a transaction sees its own prior writes, merge or no merge
    -- only how many round-trip commits it costs. Verified byte-identical
    against the non-fast path on a single-expiry smoke test (same entry/
    exit/pnl/exit_reason) before being trusted on any full `--all-expiries`
    run; see the project handover notes for that comparison's actual
    numbers, not just this claim.
